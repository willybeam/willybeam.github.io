<h1 style="text-align:center;">VW Dune Buggy</h1>

<p>My Volkswagen Dune Buggy has a stock 1600cc VW air-cooled engine, and a 3-rib VW Bus transmission. 
I bought it in September of 2014, as a buggy without an engine as the owner sold the engine out of it before.
My father and I began tearing the buggy apart to rebuild it the way we were comfortable. The first big project was
changing the trailing arms. It came installed with extreme trailing arms that were creating a disturbing angle on 
the CV joints, so we swapped them out with the stock trailing arms that came extra with the buggy.</p>

<p>After we corrected the trailing arms, we noticed the right side suspension was noticeably stiffer than the left.
 We corrected this by adjusting the torsion bars at the spring plates. We had never done this before, so we put 
a chain under a floor jack, and put the other end of it around the frame, to lift the spring plate high enough
 to move it away from the stop. After it was clear of the stop we slowly continued to release the spring plate 
until there was no tension. Then we pulled the plate off of the torsion bar, and put it back on a few teeth 
higher, and reassembled it.</p>

<p>There hadn't been much progress made over the winter. When spring rolled around, we started working harder 
to be ready for Memorial Day Weekend. We contacted our friend George to buy his spare engine. Getting the 
engine in was an experience on its own. The transmission had an early style throw-out bearing, while the pressure 
plate did not have the early style ring. Once we got the ring for the pressure plate, the engine went in, and 
wiring the engine was next.</p>

<p>The first time I drove the buggy it ran terribly, had only one seat, and didn't even have rear shocks. None 
of that mattered though because I was finally driving my own buggy.	  <a href="IMG_0419.mov">Video</a></p>

<p>Finishing up the buggy for Memorial day Weekend consisted of mounting seats, seat belts, rear shocks, 
making up a passenger footrest, and getting new front rims. With all of that out of the way, we were ready 
for Memorial Day Weekend.</p>

<p>Memorial Day Weekend was a great time. The buggy did great the first day, for the first 3 hours of Saturday 
morning. We hit the trails and tried to follow a smaller track. George just barely squeezed through the trees 
but I was not exactly trail proven. While trying to get in between the same trees, I one of them and the front left 
top trailing arm fell out. We fixed it on the trail quickly and we were back at it.</p>
